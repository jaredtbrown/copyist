# Copyist

A realtime address record keeping application for letter writing built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
This app requires Firebase keys. Create a free Firebase project and use your own keys and add them to a `.env.development.local` file for your local development.

Next, run `npm install` and then `npm start` to get up and running.
